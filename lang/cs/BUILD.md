Building and Testing REEF .NET
==================

Prerequisites
-------------

  * Windows OS.
  * [Building REEF Java](../java/BUILD.md).
  * [Visual Studio](http://www.visualstudio.com) 2015 (preferred) or 2013. Most REEF developers use the free Community Edition.
  * NuGet 2.8.6 or later.
  * xunit.runner.console.2.1.0 package (installing it might require manual restore of NuGet packages).


Instructions
------------

To build and run tests in Visual Studio, open `lang\cs\Org.Apache.REEF.sln`, build entire solution and run all tests in Test Explore.

To build REEF.NET from command line, execute

    msbuild .\lang\cs\Org.Apache.REEF.sln

To run .NET tests from command line, execute

    msbuild .\lang\cs\TestRunner.proj

Continuous Integration
------------

We use [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) to run continuous integration for REEF .NET code (i.e. build and run tests
for all pull requests and commits to master branch).

It can be convenient to set up AppVeyor for your fork of REEF repository, for example, to reproduce a test failure which
can't be reproduced locally.

1. Log in to [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/) using your GitHub credentials.
2. Go to [project creation](https://ci.appveyor.com/projects/new) and select reef repository.
3. Fine-tune configuration as required at Settings tab of repository; you can enable building pushes to your repository
   when you're investigating something and disable them when you don't need them.
4. Edit [AppVeyor configuration file](../../appveyor.yml) as required (by default you'll use the same configuration as REEF build).

Instructions on Building and Testing REEF .NET from Scratch
------------

Here is a step-by-step guide, if the instructions above didn't work and/or you prefer to build REEF .NET from Windows Command Prompt/PowerShell.

1. Install Java Development Kit 7 or 8. Set `JAVA_HOME` as an Environment Variable
    * Go [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads) to download and install appropriate JDK
    * Go to System Properties -> Environment Variables -> System Variables -> New...
    * Create a variable called `JAVA_HOME` and set the value to be your jdk installation dir, like C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_91
    * Update the Environment Variable `Path` by adding `%JAVA_HOME%\bin`

2. Install Maven 3.3.9. Set `M2_HOME` and `M2` as Environment Variables
    * Go [here](https://archive.apache.org/dist/maven/maven-3/3.3.9/binaries/) to download apache-maven-3.3.9-bin.zip
    * Unzip it and place it to your desired location
    * Create an Environment Variable called `M2_HOME` and set the value to be your unzip location, like C:\Program Files\Apache\apache-maven-3.3.9
    * Create another variable called `M2` and set the value to be `%M2_HOME%\bin`
    * Update the Environment Variable `Path` by adding `%M2%` and `%M2_HOME%`

3. Install Protocol Buffer 2.5. Add its path as an Environment Variable
    * Go [here](https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases/tag/v2.5.0) to download protoc-2.5.0-win32.zip
    * Unzip it and place it to your desired location. Make sure that protoc.exe is in that folder
    * Update the Environment Variable `Path` by adding the unzip location, like C:\protobuf-2.5.0\src\protoc-2.5.0-win32

4. Git clone the repo to your local machine: `git clone git@github.com:apache/reef.git`

5. Build and test REEF .Net using Maven: `mvn clean install`
